### Database Setup

To generate the database, you need `sqlite3`.\

#### Linux
On Linux, it can be installed with `sudo apt-get install sqlite3`.\


To generate the database, run in `dsu.tools/database/` the command `sqlite3 dsutools.sqlite < schemas/generate.sql`.

#### Windows
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


### Database Introspection
Pro Tip: You can use software like DBeaver to open a database file and browse it. This is really handy when you want to know what the database contains.
