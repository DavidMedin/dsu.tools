# dsu.tools Backend Server

The backend server for dsu.tools is written in Rust.

We use the web framework [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) for the web framework.

To install Rust, install the `rustup` tool and run `rustup install stable`.

To build the project, run `cargo build`.\
Or, to build and run the project in one step, run `cargo run`.\
Before running the server, make sure to build the frontend using Vite as mentioned in the `dsutools-frontend/README.md` file.\
